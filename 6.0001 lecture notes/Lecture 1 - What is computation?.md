- Types of knowledge:
	- Declarative knowledge - statements of fact
	- imperative knowledge - a recipe or "how to" for the computer to follow
- What is a recipe?
	1. A sequence of simple steps
	2. flow of control process that specifies when each step is executed
	3. a means of determining when to stop
	- 1+2+3 = an algorithm!
- How to capture a recipe in a mechanical process?
	- **fixed program computer**: ex. a handheld calculator, older computers - it can only do 1 thing, if you need it to do tasks other than math operations you can't and need to build a new machine
	- **stored program computer**: ex. all modern computers. a machine that stores and executes instructions
- Basic machine architecture for stored program computer
	- 1. Memory
		- contains data, sequence of instructions
		- instructions are built from predefined set of primitive instructions
			- arithmetic and logic
			- simple tests
			- move data around
	- 2. control unit
		- contains a program counter - starts with the first sequence/instruction and sends it to the ALU
		- decides which instruction to execute next
	- 3. arithmetic logic unit (ALU)
		- does primitive operations
		- once its done we iterate until all instructions are done
	- input/output
-  Basic primitives
	- Alan Turing showed that anything can be computed using 6 primitives: move left, move right, read, write, scan, do nothing
	- modern programming languages give you a more convenient set of primitives to use, also let you create new ones
	- anything computable in one language is computable in any other programming language
- Creating recipes
	- programing languages give you a set of primitive **operations**
	- **expressions** are complex but valid combinations of primitives in a programming language
	- expressions and computations have **values** and meanings in a programming language
- Aspects of languages
	- valid **syntax**
		- "hi"5 --> bad python syntax
		- 3.2\*5 --> good python syntax
	- **static semantics** - which syntactically valid strings have meaning?
		- "I are hungry" --> sytactically valid but static semantic error
		- 3.2\*5 --> syntactically valid
		- 3.2+"hi" --> static semantic error
	- **semantics**: the meaning associated with a syntactically correct string of symbols with no static semantic errors
		- English can have many meanings "Flying planes can be dangerous"
		- Programming languages will always have one meaning, but may not be what you intended it to do
- Where things go wrong
	- **syntactic errors** - common and easily caught
	- **static semantic errors** - some languages check for these before running program, can cause unpredictable behavior
	- no semantic errors but **different meaning than what programmer intended** - program crashes, stops running, runs forever, gives an answer but different than expected
- Python programs
	- **program** - a sequence of definitions and commands
		- definitions are **evaluated**, commands are **executed** by python interpreter in a shell
	- **commands** - instruct interpreter to do something
	- can be typed directly in a **shell** or stored in a **file** that is read into the shell and evaluated
- Objects
	- everything in python is an object
	- programs manipulate **data objects**
	- objects have a **type** that defines the kinds of things programs can do to them
	- objects are either:
		- **scalar** - cannot be subdivided, ex. the number 5
		- **non-scalar** - have internal structure that can be accessed, ex. a list of numbers
- Scalar objects (in python)
	- int - represents **integers**, ex. 5
	- float - represents **real numbers**, ex. 3.27
	- bool - represents Boolean values True and False
	- NoneType - **special** and has one value of None
	- type() reveals the type of an object, ex. type(5) returns int
	- you can convert objects in python from one type to another
- need "print" to show output from code to a user in the console
- Expressions
	- expressions are made from **combining objects and operators** and will always resolve to a **value** which has a **type**
	- syntax for an expression is always: `<object> <operator> <object>`
	- operators on ints and floats are sum, difference, product, division, remainder, and power
		- mixed typing in sum/difference/product will result in a float
		- division always results in float no matter the typing
- Binding variables and values
	- the equal sign is an **assignment** of a value to a variable name
	- the value is stored in computer memory and the assignment binds a name to a value
	- names allow you to reuse the name instead of the value, makes it easier to change code later
- Programming vs math: in programming, you do not "solve for X" - you can only have one thing to the left of the equal sign (an assignment)
- You can **rebind** variable names using new assignment statements - unused values will be stored in memory until garbage collected
