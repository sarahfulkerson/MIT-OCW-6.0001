- 3 ways to maintain high quality code
	- **Defensive programming** - try to keep bugs from entering your code in the first place
		- Write specifications for functions
		- Modularize programs
		- Check conditions on inputs/outputs (assertions)
	- **Testing/validation** - compare your inputs and outputs against specifications; is it doing what I expect?
	- **Debugging** - study the events leading to an error to determine why code is not doing what you expect it to
- When are you ready to test?
	- When code runs - no syntax or static semantic errors
	- When you have a set of expected inputs and outputs
- Classes of test
	- **unit testing**
		- validate each piece of the program
		- test each function separately
	- **regression testing**
		- add tests for bugs as you find them
		- catch reintroduced errors that were previously fixed
	- **integration testing**
		- test the program as a whole
		- don't rush towards this one! testing is a cycle
- Testing approaches
	- try and come up with some **natural boundaries** to the problem you are trying to solve with code
	- if no natural boundaries, **random testing** of many different inputs is the next best option
	- **black box testing** - explore paths through code specifications
	- **glass box testing** - explore paths through code
