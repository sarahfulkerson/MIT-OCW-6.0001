# MIT 6.0001 - Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python (Fall 2016) - Problem Sets

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets for MIT's 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python course, Fall 2016 edition.

## About the Course

MIT's 6.0001 is an introductory course to computer science, using Python 3.5 as the primary language. The course aims to provide a foundation in computational thinking and problem-solving through programming. It covers fundamental concepts such as:

*   Basic computation and algorithms
*   Branching and iteration
*   String manipulation
*   Decomposition and abstraction using functions
*   Data structures like tuples, lists, and dictionaries
*   Recursion
*   Testing and debugging
*   Object-oriented programming
*   Basic program efficiency concepts (searching and sorting)

For more information about the course, including lecture notes, you can visit the [official MIT OpenCourseWare page](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/pages/syllabus/).

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

*   `Pset0/`: Solutions for Problem Set 0
*   `Pset1/`: Solutions for Problem Set 1
*   `Pset2/`: Solutions for Problem Set 2
*   `Pset3/`: Solutions for Problem Set 3
*   `Pset4/`: Solutions for Problem Set 4
*   `Pset5/`: Solutions for Problem Set 5

Each directory contains the Python code (`.py` files) that represents my solution to the respective problem set.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are provided for educational purposes only.  It is recommended that you attempt the problem sets yourself before consulting these solutions.  Using these solutions without proper engagement with the course material may hinder your learning process.
